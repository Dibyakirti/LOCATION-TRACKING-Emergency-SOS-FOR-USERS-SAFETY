Location Tracking & Emergency SOS for Users Safety” is a thoughtful fusion of technology and empathy—designed to be a silent companion in moments when safety becomes uncertain. With rising concerns around personal security, especially for women, this Android application was developed as a real-time guardian that never sleeps.

Unlike generic safety apps, this solution listens for shakes, responds to panic taps, and even understands distress words like “Help” or “Danger.” It instantly sends the user’s live location, battery level, and a pre-stored emergency message to trusted contacts—without the user even needing to unlock their phone or make a call.

What sets this project apart is its multi-layered intelligence:

It tracks repeat SOS activity in specific areas and marks them as danger zones.

It enables voice activation, ensuring help can be summoned even when hands are tied.

It embeds a QR scanner to quickly capture vehicle details during travel emergencies.

It functions even offline, ensuring support isn’t lost when the network is.

All of this is wrapped in a clean, intuitive interface developed with Android Studio, utilizing background services, GPS APIs, SMS integration, and persistent notifications to ensure round-the-clock reliability.

But more than the code and features, this project reflects a mission: to create digital courage. It allows users to move freely, travel alone, and live fearlessly—knowing that someone, somewhere, is just a shake away.

With future potential to sync with local authorities and public safety systems, this application is more than a final-year project. It’s a prototype of protection, designed by students who believe that safety is not a privilege—it’s a right.
